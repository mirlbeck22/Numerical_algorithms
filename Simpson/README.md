# simpson.d
##### Description
This algorithm computes an itegral using Simpon's 1/3 Rule.  This method is far superior in accuracy as compared to the trapezoidal rule.  However, if the number of intervals is odd, it will use the trapezoidal rule on the last interval.
###### Inputs
1. x = one dimentional array of data points
2. y = one dimension array of data points with respect to x
###### Outputs
1. I = integral under the data points
