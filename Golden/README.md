 # golden.m 
 ##### Description
 This algorithm determines the maximum of a function using the golden method.  The golden method uses a mathematical concept known as the golden ratio to decrease original bracket.  This method is classified as a closed bracketing method and has been found to be more computationally efficient than its false position and bisection methods.
 ###### Inputs 
 1. func = function 
 2. xl = lower bracket on root 
 3. xu = upper bracket on root 
 4. es = maximum absolute approximate error allowed (enter as a percent) 
 5. maxiter = max number of interations algorithms will perform 
 ###### Outputs 
 1. root = guess at root 
 2. function value at root 
 3. ea = approximate error of guess 
 4. iter = number of iterations performed
